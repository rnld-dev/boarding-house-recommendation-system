This recommendation system is developed using the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering analysis approach with Gower distance as the distance metric. It enables users to find accommodations that align with their preferences. The system predicts the preference cluster of the user and provides recommendations for accommodations within the same cluster based on Gower distance proximity.
